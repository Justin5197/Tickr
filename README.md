Personal Finance &amp; Investing Application



Who are we?
We are Tickr, a team comprised of 5 Georgia State University students, taking Software Engineering (Spring 2018). Over the course of the Spring 2018 semester, under the supervision and guidance of our Proffessor Awad Mussa, we have worked to creat Tickr, an Adroid based app that allows you to track your finances.

What is your product, on a high level?
•	Our product is an app that allows users to track their finances. Whether that’s bank balance, stock portfolios and even cryptocurrency portfolios. The users can create an account, link their bank, and then begin to add multiple investments that they have made. Therefore, our application will keep track of all those investments and then give an overall worth of the portfolio based on those multiple investments.

What problem does it solve?
•	Keeping up with all your finances might be time consuming especially if you invest in a personal portfolio. Therefore, our app solves the problem of keeping track of the finances happening in your bank as well as the investments that the user makes on either stocks or cryptocurrencies. 

What technology is the system using?
•	The system will be built on the Android platform, not all the team members were familier with this software, so this presented a steep learnig curve for us, however we managed to complete the project. 
•	In order to retrieve data to input into our application, we have already researched some API’s that allow for stocks and cryptocurrency price retrieval such as Plaid API and the Alpha Vantage API.
